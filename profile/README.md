# Open Home Foundation

The **Open Home Foundation** fights for the fundamental principles of **privacy**, **choice**, and **sustainability** for smart homes. And for every person who lives in one. It does this by supporting the development of open-source projects, and open connectivity and communication standards.

A big part of our work is the ownership and governance of over 240 projects, open standards, drivers, and libraries that support the realization of the open home. Some are small projects to solve simple problems. Others represent major efforts to create open standards, prevent vendor lock-in, and protect privacy. Many are being used well beyond the smart home space. And weâ€™re pretty proud of that. 

You can find all of our projects, standards, drivers and libraries in the following repositories:
